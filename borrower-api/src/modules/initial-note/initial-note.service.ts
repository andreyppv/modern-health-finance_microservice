In addition, should I default under the terms of this Note, you may, at your option, add all accrued and unpaid interest to the principal balance of my Loan upon such default. Such Capitalized Interest is thereafter considered principal and interest will accrue on the new principal balance at the Interest Rate. In addition, if I am in default under this Note, you may, at your option, add any unpaid late charges, Returned Payment Fees or other charges outstanding at the time of default to the principal amount of my Loan.</li>
              <li style="padding-bottom:15px"> Annual Percentage Rate (“APR”) – The APR for my Loan will be disclosed to me on my Disclosure Statement. The APR may be higher than the Interest Rate described above because the APR will include any fee that is charged for my Loan as well as the rate at which interest accrues.</li>

          <div style="   padding:10px">  TERMS OF REPAYMENT</div>
          <div  style="   padding:10px">
            <ol>
              <li style="padding-bottom:15px"> Repayment Options – I acknowledge that I may choose either the Interest Only Option or Full Principal and Interest Option, subject to my eligibility. Not all Borrowers are eligible for the Interest Only Option. The Repayment Option I choose will determine when the Principal Repayment Period under the Loan will commence. I understand that my choice of the Repayment Option will be made during the Application process.</li>
              <li style="padding-bottom:15px"> Interest Only Option– If I am eligible and have selected the Interest Only Option, I will make consecutive monthly payments during the Interest-Only Period on or before the due dates specified in the monthly statements you will send me. The first payment during the Interest- Only Period will be due thirty (30) to forty-five (45) days following the Disbursement Date. The amount of the monthly payments will be determined at the time the Interest-Only Period begins to equal the accrued and unpaid interest on the disbursed amount of my Loan at the Interest Rate then in effect, but not less than the Minimum Payment described below. The monthly interest payment amount so determined will be specified in the monthly statements you will send to me. The Principal Repayment Period of my Loan will begin following the expiration of the Interest-Only Period and the monthly payments due and payable during the Principal Repayment Period will be as described in this Note under “Full Principal and Interest Option” below. The first payment during the Principal Repayment Period will be due thirty (30) to forty- five (45) days following the expiration of the Interest-Only Period, as specified in the monthly statement you send me. In order to elect to make interest-only payments, I will give notice of the election and pay the amount due as shown on my monthly billing statement.</li>
              <li style="padding-bottom:15px"> Full Principal and Interest Option – If I have selected the Full Principal and Interest Option, I will make consecutive monthly payments during the Principal Repayment Period on or before the due dates specified in the monthly statements you will send me until I have paid all of the principal and interest and all other charges and fees payable under this Note. The first payment during the Principal Repayment Period will be due and payable between thirty (30) to forty-five (45) days following the Disbursement Date. The amount of the monthly payments will be determined at the time the Principal Repayment Period begins to equal the amount necessary to amortize the disbursed and remaining unpaid principal balance (including any Capitalized Interest or other capitalized charges and fees added to the principal amount) of the Loan in equal installments of principal and interest on the unpaid principal balance at the Interest Rate then in effect over the number of months in the Principal Repayment Period, but not less than the Minimum Payment described below. The monthly amortizing payment amount so determined will be specified in the monthly statements you will send to me.</li>
              <li style="padding-bottom:15px"> Minimum Repayment – Notwithstanding the repayment terms described above, I agree that my monthly payment will never be less than
                $75.00 or the unpaid balance, whichever is less. I understand that this may result in the Principal Repayment Period being less than sixty
                (60) or one hundred and twenty (120) months as applicable.</li>
              <li style="padding-bottom:15px"> Amounts Owing at the End of the Principal Repayment Period – Since interest accrues daily upon the unpaid principal balance of my Loan, if I make payments after my payment due dates, I may owe additional interest. If I have not paid my late charges, I will also owe additional amounts for those late charges. In such cases you will increase the amount of my last monthly payment to the amount necessary to repay my Loan in full.</li>
              <li style="padding-bottom:15px"> Payments – Payments will be applied first to accrued interest, then to principal, and the remainder to late charges, other fees and other charges.</li>
              <li style="padding-bottom:15px"> Other Charges - If any part of a monthly payment remains unpaid for a period of more than 10 days after the payment due date, I will pay a late charge of 5% of the unpaid amount of the payment due or $10.00, whichever is less. I will also pay a NSF Fee of $15.00 for each payment on this Note returned for any reason.</li>

          <div style="   padding:10px">  LOAN ORIGINATION FEE</div>
          <div  style="   padding:10px">I will pay a Loan Origination Fee to you when the loan proceeds are disbursed. The amount of the Loan Origination Fee is equal to the Loan amount multiplied by 2.0%. The amount of the Loan Origination Fee will be deducted from the disbursed amount of my Loan, but will be included in the principal balance of my Loan. If I prepay this loan in full or in part, I will not be entitled to any refund of any part of the Loan Origination Fee unless otherwise required by applicable law.</div>

          <div  style="   padding:10px">I have the right to prepay all or any part of my Loan at any time without penalty. Any partial prepayment will be applied to the accrued interest and then to the principal of my Loan and will not reduce the next payment due on my Loan.</div>
        </div>
        <div style="padding-bottom:20px">
          <div style="   padding:10px"> REPAYMENT PLAN CHANGE MODIFICATION</div>
          <div  style="   padding:10px">If I am in default as described below, I may request that you modify these terms. I understand that such modification would be solely at your option and subject to any requirements you may establish. If I have selected the Interest Only Option, I may request that you extend the Interest Only Period for up to 90 days. If I have selected the Full Principal and Interest Option, I may request that you change my payments to interest-only payments. I understand that I will remain responsible for all interest accruing during any period of forbearance and that you will add any interest that I do not pay during any forbearance period to the principal balance as described in paragraph D.3. If I originally selected the Full Principal and Interest Option and you grant me a modification, any such change to interest-only payments would be for half (1/2) of the remaining Total Repayment Period or ninety (90) days, whichever is longer. I understand that in some instances this will cause the Total Repayment period to extend beyond the originally agreed upon term. I also understand and agree that after the modification period ends, you will recalculate my monthly payments to be the amount necessary to amortize the outstanding balance of my Loan at the Interest Rate over the remainder of the Total Repayment Period and that those payments may be greater than those shown in the Disclosure Statement. I also agree that, if I originally selected the Full Principal and Interest Option and you have granted me a modification, my Interest Rate will increase by 2.0 percentage points and remain at the increased level for the remainder of the Total Repayment Period.</div>

          <div  style="   padding:10px">Except as provided below and to the extent permitted by applicable law, I will be in default under the terms of this Note (subject to any applicable law which may give me a right to cure my default) if: (1) I have more than 1 full payment past due and this amount remains unpaid for more than 14 days after its due date, or I fail to pay my first or last payment within 40 days after such payment is due, (2) I break any of my other promises in this Note that materially impairs my ability to pay the amounts owed, (3) any bankruptcy proceeding is begun by or against me, or I assign any assets for the benefit of my creditors, (4) I make any false statement in applying for this Loan or at any time thereafter that material impairs my ability to pay the amounts owed. If I live in Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, or South Carolina, I will be in default if I fail to make a payment when due or the prospect of my payment or performance is significantly or materially impaired. If I live in Iowa, I will be in default if I fail to make a payment within ten (10) days of its due date or if the prospect of my payment or performance is significantly or materially impaired. If I live in West Virginia, I will be in default if I fail to make a payment within five (5) days of its due date or if I otherwise fail to perform pursuant to this Credit Agreement.<br />
            <br />
            If I default you have the right to give me notice that the whole outstanding principal balance, accrued interest, and all other amounts payable to you under the terms of this Note, are due and payable at once but if I live in Virginia no sooner than 10 days after the payment due date and if I live in the District of Columbia no sooner than 30 days after the payment due date. You also have the right to cancel any disbursements not yet made. If I default, I will be required to pay interest on this Loan accruing after default. The interest rate after default will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as before default. If I default, you may also, at your option, add all accrued and unpaid interest to the principal balance of my Loan upon such default.</div>

Further, unless both you and I agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not join or consolidate Claims with claims of any other persons. No arbitrator shall have authority to conduct any arbitration in violation of this provision or to issue any relief that applies to any person or entity except you and me individually.<br />
            <br />
            PROCEDURES: If I reside in the U.S., any arbitration hearing shall take place within the federal judicial district in which I reside. If I reside outside the United States, I agree that any arbitration hearing shall take place in San Francisco, California. Each party will bear the expense of its own attorneys, experts and witnesses, regardless of which party prevails, unless applicable law or this Agreement gives a right to recover any of those fees from the other party. If my Claim is for $10,000 or less, you agree that I may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If my Claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. All fees and expenses of the arbitrator and administrative fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be paid by the parties as provided by the AAA Rules governing the proceeding, or by specific ruling by the arbitrator or by agreement of the parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award in favor of the individual party seeking relief all remedies permitted by applicable substantive law, including, without limitation, compensatory, statutory and punitive damages (subject to constitutional limits that would apply in court), and attorneys’ fees and costs. In addition, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief but only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted in that party’s individual Claim. Upon the timely request of either party, the arbitrator shall write a brief explanation of the basis of his or her award. Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator’s award. If the arbitrator determines that any claim or defense is frivolous or wrongfully intended to oppress the other party, the arbitrator may award sanctions in the form of fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the other party (including arbitration administration fees, arbitrator’s fees, and attorney, expert and witness fees), to the extent such fees and expenses could be imposed under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. NON-WAIVER: Even if all parties have opted to litigate a Claim in court, you or I may elect arbitration with respect to any Claim made by a new party or any Claim later asserted by a party in that or any related or unrelated lawsuit (including a Claim initially asserted on an individual basis but modified to be asserted on a class, representative or multi-party basis). Nothing in that litigation shall constitute a waiver of any
            
            rights under this Arbitration Agreement. For example, if you file a lawsuit against me in court to recover amounts due under the Loan Agreement, I have the right to request arbitration, but if I do not elect to request arbitration, you reserve and do not waive the right to request arbitration of any Claim (including any counterclaim) I later assert against you in that or any related or unrelated lawsuit. This Arbitration Agreement will apply to all Claims, even if the facts and circumstances giving rise to the Claims existed before the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement. Pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the FAA, and not by any state law concerning arbitration. If I have a question about the AAA, I can contact them as follows: American Arbitration Association,
            120 Broadway, Floor 21, New York, N.Y. 10271, 212-716- 5800, <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>.<br />
            <br />
            SURVIVAL, SEVERABILITY: This Arbitration Agreement shall survive full payment of the Loan, your sale or transfer of the Loan, any bankruptcy or insolvency, any forbearance or modification granted pursuant to this Agreement, any cancellation or request for cancellation of the Agreement or any disbursements under the Agreement. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found to be invalid or unenforceable by a decision of a tribunal of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, except that: (A) If a determination is made in a proceeding involving you and me that the Class Action Waiver is invalid or unenforceable, only this sentence of this Arbitration Agreement will remain in force and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, provided that the determination concerning the Class Action Waiver shall be subject to appeal, and (B) If a Claim is brought seeking public injunctive relief and a court determines that the restrictions in this Arbitration Agreement prohibiting the arbitrator from awarding relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with respect to such Claim (and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been exhausted), the Claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in court and any individual   Claims seeking monetary relief will be arbitrated.   In such a case the parties will request that the court stay the Claim for public injunctive relief until the arbitration award pertaining to individual relief has been entered in court. In no event will a Claim for public injunctive relief be arbitrated.</div>
